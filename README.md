# CIVIS – Real-Time AI Defense Against Digital Manipulation

🚀 **Live Demo:**  
https://nischay-gdgjp.netlify.app  

CIVIS is an AI-powered system that detects **psychological manipulation in digital content before misinformation spreads.**

Instead of asking:

❓ *“Is this news true?”*

CIVIS asks a deeper question:

> **“Is this content engineered to manipulate human behavior?”**

If antivirus protects computers from malware, **CIVIS protects society from manipulation.**

---

# The Problem

Misinformation spreads rapidly online — not because it is convincing, but because it is **emotionally engineered**.

Manipulative content often uses psychological triggers such as:

- Fear
- Urgency
- Outrage
- Identity conflict

These tactics bypass rational thinking and encourage people to **react and share content instantly**.

By the time fact-checkers verify the information, **the narrative may already have spread widely.**

---

# Our Solution

CIVIS introduces a **real-time AI system that detects manipulation signals in digital content.**

The platform supports **multi-modal input**, allowing analysis of:

- Text
- Voice input
- Images / screenshots

CIVIS evaluates psychological influence patterns and generates a **Manipulation Risk Score** with explanation.

This helps users **pause and critically evaluate information before believing or sharing it.**

git clone https://github.com/your-username/civis.git
cd civis
````

---

## 2. Setup Backend

Navigate to backend folder:

```bash
cd backend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file and add your API keys:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key

# Example Use Case

Example viral claim:

> “Burj Khalifa attacked by drones.”

CIVIS analyzes the content and detects:

* Fear trigger
* Urgency framing
* Geopolitical narrative

Result:

**High Manipulation Risk Score**

This demonstrates how CIVIS can warn users **before misinformation spreads.**

---
